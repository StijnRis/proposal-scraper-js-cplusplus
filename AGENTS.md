## Goal

Research project: Scrape proposal data from the JavaScript and C++ repositories, store it in a local SQLite database.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.13
- **Environment:** `uv` managing a local `venv`.
- **Primary Libraries:** `sqlite3`
- **Style:** Clean functional paradigm utilizing strict explicit type hints.

## Execution

- Execute pipeline: `uv run main.py`
- Execute tests: `uv run pytest` (only core math/logic tests, no setup or integration tests).
- **Mandatory Verification:** Always run both the pipeline and execute tests immediately after code modifications. If runtime or test errors occur, debug and fix them instantly before adding new features.

## Evolution & Restructuring ("Addition through Removal")

When introducing new features, datasets, or logic, prioritize minimizing codebase friction:

- **Refactor First:** Do not layer new code on top of brittle architecture. Restructure, merge, or rewrite existing functions to cleanly absorb new requirements.
- **Addition through Removal:** Actively delete dead code, deprecated logic, and redundant helper functions. Keeping the codebase small is the best way to maintain velocity.
- **Synchronized Test Updates:** When changing, restructuring, or removing functions, **immediately update or delete their corresponding tests**. Never leave broken or stale tests in the codebase.
- **Zero Backward Compatibility:** Ignore historical constraints. Break existing internal APIs aggressively if it results in a cleaner, simpler codebase.

## AI Behavior & Coding Standards

### 1. Code Implementation

- **No Placeholders:** Write 100% complete, executable code. Never use inline placeholders like `# TODO` or `# ... logic goes here`.
- **Don't Reinvent the Wheel:** Lean heavily on libraries to process data rather than writing custom logic.

### 2. Architecture & Design

- **Modular Functions:** Write small, single-purpose, highly testable functions. Avoid complex, monolithic classes.
- **Strict Typing:** Apply precise type hints to all variables, arguments, and return types. The `Any` type is strictly forbidden.

### 3. Testing Philosophy

- **Ultra-Minimal Tests:** Write the absolute bare minimum number of tests required to prove core math, data transformations, or critical pipeline logic works. Avoid complex test suites or testing trivial setup code.
- **Keep Pace with Changes:** Treat tests as living documentation that must change instantly alongside the source code.

### 4. Execution Safety & Performance

- **Natural Propagation:** Allow exceptions to bubble up naturally to catch failures early. Avoid silent `try-except` blocks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Write code that processes large research datasets efficiently (e.g., proper use of pandas vectors, avoiding unnecessary data duplication).

### 5. Documentation

- **Self-Documenting:** Rely on highly descriptive function and variable names.
- **Minimalist Comments:** Omit docstrings and inline comments unless explaining a non-obvious, complex mathematical algorithm.
